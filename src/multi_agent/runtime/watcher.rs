//! Background watcher task — the fan-in coordinator for child results.
//!
//! Session 20260903_0cf95e79 redesign: instead of waking the parent for
//! every single result (which pushed the "are we done yet?" decision into
//! the parent's LLM — it misread a frozen inventory `tool_count` as a stall
//! and started doing the children's work itself), the watcher now owns the
//! coordination:
//!
//! - **Progress** — each result is announced for the *user* immediately
//!   (Ok: Focus summary once wired, plain notice otherwise; Error: the
//!   error's first line, ANSI/control sanitized; Closed: plain notice).
//!   Progress never
//!   wakes the parent agent.
//! - **Batch** — once the registry is quiescent (see
//!   [`AgentRegistry::quiescent`]: nobody executing, nothing queued, and
//!   every registered agent has delivered ≥1 result) and at least one
//!   non-Closed report is pending, the watcher emits one `Batch` carrying
//!   every full report. The parent wakes exactly once per generation of
//!   children and runs one synthesis turn.
//!
//! Rules encoded here:
//! - A redundant `Closed` for an agent whose `Ok`/`Error` is already in the
//!   batch is dropped — close-after-complete is bookkeeping noise.
//! - A batch that contains only `Closed` results never wakes the parent
//!   (the user closed the children; there is nothing to synthesize). They
//!   were surfaced as Progress and the batch resets so stale notifications
//!   cannot leak into a later generation's batch.
//! - The Focus summary never gates the wake (session 20260903_d8fc41dc:
//!   awaited summaries serialized their timeouts in front of the batch).
//!   Ok results get a plain Progress notice synchronously, then the summary
//!   runs detached and follows as a second Progress event whenever Focus
//!   answers (or not at all on failure). A Progress event may therefore
//!   arrive after the Batch event, and the same agent may Progress twice —
//!   consumers must be idempotent (phimint's UI is: mark-finished is a
//!   no-op on an already-finished entry). Closed results need no summary
//!   and are announced synchronously. Error results skip Focus entirely:
//!   one synchronous Progress carrying the raw error's first line (session
//!   20260906_0f6d4341 — the user wants the real reason, not a paraphrase).
//! - Quiescence timing is **derived, not marked** (session
//!   20260904_c6559510): the child loop records facts at dequeue and before
//!   each post (`note_posted` precedes the post's seq bump), so "result
//!   drained ⇒ producer settled" holds structurally — no Done-before-post
//!   comment contract for callers to violate, and no phantom-idle window
//!   while a sibling task is still queued (`queue_len > 0` blocks the
//!   predicate directly). The delivery clause additionally seals the
//!   spawn→send window: a freshly spawned agent has zero deliveries, so a
//!   sibling's result cannot fire a batch that would exclude it.
